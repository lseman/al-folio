   abstract = {<p>The efficiency of electric motors is being improved every day and projects with design variations can improve their performance. Among electric motors, the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) is being increasingly used, because of its growing use in electric vehicles. Simulating design variations using the Finite Element Method (FEM) can improve PMSM design, and by optimizing the parameters based on the FEM, even better results can be achieved. The design of the PMSM stator slots must be evaluated, as conductors are accommodated and an electrical potential is applied at this location. The FEM parameters are varied, and the results can be used to build an approximate model, known as a proxy model. The proxy model can then be used in a mathematical programming problem to optimize the design of stators that have less electric field in certain regions, thus reducing the chance of developing a failure. The results of the proposed methodology show that its application is promising for machine design and can also be used for the design of other systems.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Modern vehicles are integrating a growing number of electronics to provide a safer experience for the driver. Therefore, safety is a non-negotiable requirement that must be considered through the vehicle development process. The ISO 26262 standard provides guidance to ensure that such requirements are implemented. Fault injection is highly recommended for the functional verification of safety mechanisms or to evaluate their diagnostic coverage capability. An exhaustive analysis is not required, but evidence of best effort through the diagnostic coverage assessment needs to be provided when performing quantitative evaluation of hardware architectural metrics. These metrics support that the automotive safety integrity level—ranging from A (lowest) to D (strictest) levels—was obeyed. In this context, this paper proposed a verification solution in order to build an approach that can accelerate the diagnostic coverage assessment via fault injection in the semiconductor level (i.e., hardware description language). The proposed solution does not require any modification of the design model to enable acceleration. Small parts of the OpenRISC architecture (namely a carry adder, the Tick Timer peripheral, and the exception block) were used to illustrate the methodology.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>During satellite development, engineers need to simulate and understand the satellite’s behavior in orbit and minimize failures or inadequate satellite operation. In this sense, one crucial assessment is the irradiance field, which impacts, for example, the power generation through the photovoltaic cells, as well as rules the satellite’s thermal conditions. This good practice is also valid for CubeSat projects. This paper presents a numerical tool to explore typical irradiation scenarios for CubeSat missions by combining state-of-the-art models. Such a tool can provide the input estimation for software and hardware in the loop analysis for a given initial condition and predict it along with the satellite’s lifespan. Three main models will be considered to estimate the irradiation flux over a CubeSat, namely an orbit, an attitude, and a radiation source model, including solar, albedo, and infrared emitted by the Earth. A case study illustrating the tool’s abilities is presented for a typical CubeSats’ two-line element set (TLE) and five attitudes. Finally, a possible application of the tool as an input to a CubeSat task-scheduling is introduced. The results show that the complete model’s use has considerable differences from the simplified models sometimes used in the literature.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The interconnection of dynamic subsystems that share limited resources are found in many applications, and the control of such systems of subsystems has fueled significant attention from scientists and engineers. For the operation of such systems, model predictive control (MPC) has become a popular technique, arguably for its ability to deal with complex dynamics and system constraints. The MPC algorithms found in the literature are mostly centralized, with a single controller receiving the signals and performing the computations of output signals. However, the distributed structure of such interconnected subsystems is not necessarily explored by standard MPC. To this end, this work proposes hierarchical decomposition to split the computations between a master problem (centralized component) and a set of decoupled subproblems (distributed components) with activation constraints, which brings about organizational flexibility and distributed computation. Two general methods are considered for hierarchical control and optimization, namely Benders decomposition and outer approximation. Results are reported from a numerical analysis of the decompositions and a simulated application to energy management, in which a limited source of energy is distributed among batteries of electric vehicles.</p>},

A proof of concept of a robotic arm with two degrees of freedom, mimicking the functions of a human’s upper limb, was built to evaluate the proposed control system. Through tests that measured the discrepancy between the angles of the human joint and the joint of the exoskeleton, it was possible to determine that the system remained within an acceptable error range. The average error is lower than 4.3%, and the robotic arm manages to mimic the movements of the upper limbs of a human in real-time.</p>},

Robust algorithms for this type of problem have been built by following algebraic approaches, but data-driven solutions are becoming more appealing due to their stochastic nature. Hence, an approach based on convolutional neural networks in order to deal with measurement uncertainty in static attitude determination problems is proposed in this paper. PointNet models were trained with different datasets containing different numbers of observation vectors that were used to build attitude profile matrices, which were the inputs of the system. The uncertainty of measurements in the test scenarios was taken into consideration when choosing the best model. The proposed model, which used convolutional neural networks, proved to be less sensitive to higher noise than traditional algorithms, such as singular value decomposition (SVD), the q-method, the quaternion estimator (QUEST), and the second estimator of the optimal quaternion (ESOQ2).</p>},

In this context, periodic inspections are carried out on the electrical networks, and ultrasound equipment is widely used, due to non-destructive analysis characteristics.

This task fundamentally depends on the operator’s experience in this interpretation.

Nevertheless, several issues must still be taken into account when developing blockchain architectures aimed at the IoT scenario because security flaws still exist in smart contracts, mainly due to the lack of ease when building the code. This article presents a blockchain storage architecture focused on license plate recognition (LPR) systems for smart cities focusing on privacy, performance, and security. The proposed architecture relies on the Ethereum platform. Each smart contract matches the privacy preferences of a license plate to be anonymized through public encryption. The storage of data captured by the LPR system can only be done if the smart contract enables it. However, in the case of motivation foreseen by the legislation, a competent user can change the smart contract and enable the storage of the data captured by the LPR system. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed architecture is satisfactory, regarding the scalability of the built private network. Furthermore, tests on our smart contract using security and structure analysis tools on the developed script demonstrate that our solution is fraud-proof. The results obtained in all experiments bring evidence that our architecture is feasible to be used in real scenarios.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Developing star trackers quickly is non-trivial. Achieving reproducible results and comparing different algorithms are also open problems. In this sense, this work proposes the use of synthetic star images (a simulated sky), allied with the standardized structure of the Universal Verification Methodology as the base of a design approach. The aim is to organize the project, speed up the development time by providing a standard verification methodology. Future rework is reduced through two methods: a verification platform that us shared under a free software licence; and the layout of Universal Verification Methodology enforces reusability of code through an object-oriented approach. We propose a black-box structure for the verification platform with standard interfaces, and provide examples showing how this approach can be applied to the development of a star tracker for small satellites, targeting a system-on-a-chip design. The same test benches were applied to both early conceptual software-only implementations, and later optimized software-hardware hybrid systems, in a hardware-in-the-loop configuration. This test bench reuse strategy was interesting also to show the regression test capability of the developed platform. Furthermore, the simulator was used to inject specific noise, in order to evaluate the system under some real-world conditions.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>In onshore oilfields, sucker rod pumps are deployed to lift fluids from wells to the surface, which are then transferred by a pipeline network to a central facility. Each pump operates according to a cyclic control policy that alternates between a period of production and a period of recess, allowing the reservoir to replenish the fluids. To minimize the peak in the electric power drawn by the sucker rods, previous works have considered the scheduling of the control policies over time. However, when the production system sprawls over a large area, the energy required to force the flow through the pipelines and the pressure drops are significant. To this end, this article develops mixed-integer nonlinear formulations and mixed-integer linear approximations for baseline control-policy scheduling and reconfiguration.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The long short-term memory (LSTM) is a high-efficiency model for forecasting time series, for being able to deal with a large volume of data from a time series with nonlinearities. As a case study, the stacked LSTM will be used to forecast the growth of the pandemic of COVID-19, based on the increase in the number of contaminated and deaths in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. COVID-19 has been spreading very quickly, causing great concern in relation to the ability to care for critically ill patients. Control measures are being imposed by governments with the aim of reducing the contamination and the spreading of viruses. The forecast of the number of contaminated and deaths caused by COVID-19 can help decision making regarding the adopted restrictions, making them more or less rigid depending on the pandemic’s control capacity. The use of LSTM stacking shows an R2 of 0.9625 for confirmed cases and 0.9656 for confirmed deaths caused by COVID-19, being superior to the combinations among other evaluated models.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>In the oil and gas industry, heat exchangers are subject to loads that cause malfunctioning. These loads are divided into thermal and mechanical stresses; however, most efforts are focused on studying thermal stresses. The present work reduces mechanical stresses by mitigating pressure events in a gasket plate heat exchanger (GPHE). GPHE requires that the hot and cold stream branches have approximately the same pressure. Thus, the work focuses on controlling the pressure difference between the branches. A test bench was used to emulate, on a small scale, the typical pressure events of an oil production plant. A control valve was used in different positions to evaluate the controller. In the experiments, it was observed that the best option to control the pressure difference is to use a hydraulic pump and control valve in the flow of the controlled thermal fluid branch. The reduction in pressure events was approximately 50%. Actuator efforts are also reduced in this configuration.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>When managing a constellation of nanosatellites, one may leverage this structure to improve the mission’s quality-of-service (QoS) by optimally distributing the tasks during an orbit. In this sense, this research proposes an offline energy-aware task scheduling problem formulation regarding the specifics of constellations, by considering whether the tasks are individual, collective, or stimulated to be redundant. By providing such an optimization framework, the idea of estimating an offline task schedule can serve as a baseline for the constellation design phase. For example, given a particular orbit, from the simulation of an irradiance model, the engineer can estimate how the mission value is affected by the inclusion or exclusion of individuals objects. The proposed model, given in the form of a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model, is illustrated in this work for several illustrative scenarios considering different sets of tasks and constellations. We also perform an analysis of the Pareto-optimal frontier of the problem, identifying the feasible trade-off points between constellation and individual tasks. This information can be useful to the decision-maker (mission operator) when planning the behavior in orbit.</p>},
