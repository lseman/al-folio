Hi! My name is Laio, I am an Electrical Engineer from Brazil. I received a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) in 2017.

From 2018 to 2019 I worked as an Assistant Professor at the Federal University of Technology - Paraná (UTFPR), Brazil.

Since 2019 I am a professor in the Graduate Program of Applied Computer Sciences, at the Itajai Valley University (UNIVALI), focusing on strategies for static and dynamic optimization, along with applications in traffic control, cyberphysical systems, and oil and gas production systems.

Also, I have been working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at UFSC, focused on optimizing production for the oil and gas industry.

In this context, I have been co-advising theses and dissertations in the area of optimization, including decomposition strategies such as Benders, Lagrange and Dantzig-Wolfe.

-- I was the Program Chair of the IV International Academy of Astronautics Latin American CubeSat Workshop (IAA-LACW 2020).
